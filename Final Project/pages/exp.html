                <h2>1.      She believes in herself</h2>
                <p class="uy">There is no space for self-doubt especially if you wish to achieve your big, lofty dreams. Powerful women believe in their capabilities and quickly ignore the negativity that may  undermine their efforts. She’s willing to take risks but plots out the best insurance plans to achieve the best outcome.</p>

                <h3>2.      She’s always planning her next move</h3>
                <p class="wow">In stories of many women in positions of power, what is common are : clear vision and planning. From their experiences, we learn that the road to success is not random. Be like those SHE-E-Os who understand the importance of plotting down their life goals and supporting them with practical action plans (with safety nets, too!). This includes putting in place financial structures such as life insurance that protect her against emergencies and unforeseen circumstances that may hold her back and/or derail her plans. An insurance policy can protect her life and livelihood and help her bounce back from any situation.</p>

            <div class="problem">
                <h4>3.      She stands up for herself and others</h4>  
                <p class="ah">She knows that one’s accomplishments mean nothing if your gifts and talents are not used to uplift others. An empowered woman pays it forward—bringing  people together and helping build communities where people feel safe, protected, and heard. She maintains integrity in all her decisions and actions, and uses her strength of character for good.</p>
