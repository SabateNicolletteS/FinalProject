                <h3>What is Women Empowerment?</h3>
                <p class="wow">Empowering women involves fostering their self-esteem, decision-making autonomy, and ability to create social change for themselves and others. This concept is closely linked to female empowerment, which is not only a basic human right but also crucial for building a more harmonious and thriving world.
                    In Western societies, the concept of female empowerment is often associated with distinct phases of the historical women's rights movement. This movement is typically divided into three waves: the first, occurring in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, focused primarily on suffrage; the second, in the 1960s, encompassed the sexual revolution and redefined women's societal roles; and the third, beginning in the 1990s, brought new perspectives to feminist thought.
                    The global push for women's empowerment and rights has gained significant traction in recent years, becoming a major worldwide movement. Events such as International Women's Empowerment Day are increasingly recognized and celebrated.</p>

                <h4>Why Should We Empower Women?</h4>  
                <p class="ah">Empowering women is crucial for global progress, as they represent half the world's population yet often encounter barriers to economic participation. By enabling women's economic engagement, we can potentially add trillions to global GDP, fostering diverse workforces that enhance innovation and productivity. Educated women not only break cycles of poverty by ensuring their children receive education but also contribute to healthier, more informed communities. Their empowerment leads to better health decisions, resulting in lower infant and maternal mortality rates and improved public health. Additionally, women tend to reinvest a significant portion of their income back into their families, strengthening local economies and fostering community involvement in governance. With diverse perspectives, women offer unique insights that drive innovation and comprehensive solutions to global challenges. Moreover, gender equality correlates with reduced violence and conflict, while empowered women play a vital role in environmental stewardship and sustainable practices. Ultimately, empowering women is not just a moral imperative but a strategic necessity for a prosperous, peaceful, and sustainable future for all.</p>
